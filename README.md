EndlessAlgo
Welcome to EndlessAlgo — where problem-solving never ends!
Because who needs sleep or social life when you can solve just six more problems every day... forever? 😅

This repo is a daily dose of algorithmic madness with a twist:

No 100-day challenge nonsense. Nope, this is infinite — like your caffeine intake. ☕
Solve problems in any language you want — polyglot power, baby! 🦄
This is not your normal “100 days challenge.” Nope, this is a lifestyle — like sleep, food, and breathing. You just do it every day, no questions asked.
Warning: Side effects may include brain gains, obsession with code, and occasional existential questions like “Wait, am I coding or is coding coding me?”

"Can you believe this repo is infinite... like the expansion of the cosmos?" 🚀💻

Join the madness, contribute, learn, and remember — the algorithmic grind never stops! 💻🔥
