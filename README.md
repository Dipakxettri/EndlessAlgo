# ♾️ EndlessAlgo

**Welcome to EndlessAlgo — where problem-solving never ends!** Because who needs sleep or a social life when you can solve just six more problems every day... forever? 😅

### 🚀 The Mission
This repo is a daily dose of algorithmic madness with a twist:

* **Beyond 100 Days:** No "100-day challenge" nonsense. This is infinite — like your caffeine intake. ☕
* **Polyglot Power:** Solve problems in any language you want. 🦄
* **A New Lifestyle:** This isn't just a challenge; it’s a habit — like eating, breathing, and debugging. You just do it, no questions asked.

> **Warning:** Side effects may include massive brain gains, code obsession, and occasional existential questions like: *"Wait, am I coding or is coding coding me?"*

### 🌌 Philosophy
